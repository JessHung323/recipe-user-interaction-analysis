## **Introduction**
Who doesn't love cooking? ðŸ˜†

When people search for recipes online and skim through the webpage for each one, it is natural for one to pay extra attention on the amount of time needed to complete the dish and how well this recipe has been rated by previous users because afterall, you want to make something that tastes good and is not a waste of your time. 

Our project tries to analyze the relationship between the time (in minutes) a recipe takes and its corresponding rating, and answer the question:

***What is the relationship between the cooking time and average rating of recipes?***

Perhaps a longer recipe will receive lower rating because as one completes the recipe that takes a super long time, and realizes the outcome is not as "wow" as expected, then the user may be more likely to leave a low rating. While at the same time, a recipe that takes less time may be less sophisticated in developing flavors and presentation, hence the rating for these recipes may also be lower. Which one is more intuitive for you?


## **Cleaning and EDA**
### **Data Cleaning**
In the data cleaning process, we:
1. Left merged the `RAW_recipes.csv` with `RAW_interactions.csv` to generate a new dataframe that contains recipes and reviews from `RAW_interactions.csv` that only have a match id in the `RAW_recipes.csv`.
2. Replaced all rating `0` with `np.NaN` as a `0` rating essentially means the user did not leave a rating for the recipe they used.
3. Calculated the average rating for each recipe and assigned this new series as a new column of the dataframe.
4. Splitted the `nutrition` column into 7 new columns: 
		`'calories'`, `'total fat'`, `'sugar'`, '`sodium'`, `'protein'`, `'saturated fat'`, `'carbohydrate'`, each in the type `float`.

### ***Univariate Analysis***
#### **Plot 1 - Distribution of `minutes`**
For this plot, we intend to plot the distribution of the `minutes` column in the dataframe. As we performed the plotting directly, this is the resulting plot: 
<iframe src="assets/count-minutes-with-extremes.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
As one can see, the distribution is extremely skewed to the right because of extreme outliers.

Due to the lack of clarity of this plot, we decided to remove the top 5 outliers using the threshold of 100000 minutes. This is the resulting plot:
<iframe src="assets/count-minutes-without-extremes.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>
This newly generated plot is still very right-skewed, hence we decided to use the interquartile quartertile range (IQR) of the data to determine the outliers defined as follows:

Recipes with 
1. `minutes` < 25th quartile - 1.5 * IQR or 
2. `minutes` > 75th quartile + 1.5 * IQR

are considered as outliers.

The final distribution of `minutes` we have is:
<iframe src="assets/count-minutes-without-outliers.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

This final plot is the clearest among all three, but we can observe spikes on `minutes` that are ending in 0s and 5s. We believe this is the result of recipe contributors' habits and convention of rounding their recipes' time to the nearest 10s or 5s. 


#### **Plot 2 - Distribution of `rating_original`**
We decided to plot the distirbution of `rating_original` in the dataframe.
<iframe src="assets/rating-distribution.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We can see that the `rating_original` is left-skewed and there is no value at 0. This is because we have replaced all `0` ratings at the data cleaning process.


### ***Bivariate Analysis***
#### **Plot 1 - Scatterplot with `minutes` and `n_steps`**
Before plotting the relationship between `minutes` and `n_steps`, we have decided to first group the dataframe by `recipe_id`. This is because one recipe may have multiple users, hence representing just one recipe would be enough.

This scatterplot shows the relationship between `minutes` and `n_steps`.
<iframe src="assets/scatter-minutes-nsteps.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Intuitively, one may think that the longer the time a recipe takes, the more steps are involved. However, the linear regression line shows that the relationship is very weak. This is due to the extreme outliers on the right, while the values of `n_steps` are relatively reasonable in comparison.

#### **Plot 2 - Scatterplot with `minutes` and `rating`**
Using the same grouped dataframe as above, this scatterplot shows the relationship between `minutes` and `rating_average`:
<iframe src="assets/scatter-minutes-rating.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We observe a very weak relationship between these two variables. We believe this is due to the extreme outliers in `minutes`, while `rating_average` is capped at 5.


## **Assessment of Missingness**

### **NMAR Analysis**
We believe that the `review` column in the interactions dataframe can be NMAR because perhaps the user never really completed the recipe they started on, hence the review would be missing in this case. That being said, if we are able to obtain an additional column indicating whether the user truly finished the recipe, we may be able to determine that the missingness of `review` is MAR for the reason stated above.

### **Missingness Dependency**
#### **Plot 1 - Missingness of `minutes` on `rating_original`**
<iframe src="assets/missing-minute-orig-rating.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

We fail to reject the null, hence we conclude that the missingness in the `minutes` column is not dependent on the `rating_original`.

#### **Plot 2 - Missingness of `minutes` on `n_steps`**
<iframe src="assets/missing-minute-name.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

In this case, we reject the null, hence we conclude that the missingness in the `minutes` column is dependent on the`n_steps` column. We can further conclude that there is a relationship between minute and number of steps it takes for a recipe to be completed.


## **Permutation Testing**

*Null Hypothesis*: In the population, the average rating of recipes with `minutes` under the median `minutes` of the dataset has the same average rating of recipes with `minutes` above the median `minutes` -- the ratings of the two samples come from the same population distribution.

*Alternative Hypothesis*: In the population, the average rating of recipes with `minutes` under the median `minutes` of the dataset is higher than the average rating of recipes with `minutes` above the median `minutes`.

*Test Statistic*: The difference in means of the average ratings of the two samples of the dataset.

*Significance Level*: 0.05

*p-value*: 0.0

*Conclusion*: We reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are from the same distribution.

We believe, intuitively, that the average ratings of recipes that require fewer minutes will receive higher rating. However, we need to select a threshold to determine how to separate the two samples. Median is the more natural choice because it is more robust against outliers (as we have shown in previous sections, there exists some extreme outliers in the dataset). Using the median, we are able to separate the samples and retrieve the mean of of average ratings of each sample. Since we are trying to prove that average rating of the first sample (sample with lower minutes) is higher than the second, we use signed difference in mean, instead of absolute difference in mean.
